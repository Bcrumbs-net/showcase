## Your data on our cloud

### Testing locally
If you stored your data on a Showcase headless CMS account, you can tell the code to fetch the data from that account by adding your domain linked to that account as a query-string parameter in the URL:
```
http://localhost:3000/?host=<your-domain>
```

```console
npm run build
```
Or
```console
yarn run build
```

Also you have the option to build the project as a Docker image by using the next command:
```console
docker build .
```

You can render a section using a specific content by using the `RenderSectionWithContent`, as the next example:
